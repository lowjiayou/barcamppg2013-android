Dependency:
==========
This project uses ActionBarSherlock for a backward compatible actionbar, so we need to add in the actionbar sherlock as a library project to make it work.

So we need to do the following:

1. Download the library from here: https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock, and import the 'actionbarsherlock' folder into eclipse.
2. Import this project into Eclipse, then, right click on the project folder, then:
Properties--> choose Android tab--> Add --> choose 'actionbarsherlock' that you just imported --> Ok
